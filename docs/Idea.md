(AI-Assisted Customer Support Dashboard)



### **The Idea**

Think of this as building a **mini customer support tool**, like a stripped-down version of **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk**, but with some **AI features** built in. Companies use it to handle messages from their customers.



### **How It Works (Core Stuff)**

1. **Companies sign up** → each company has its own workspace.
2. Inside a company:

   * **Agents** handle tickets (support requests).
   * **Supervisors** oversee agents.
   * **Customers** are the people sending in tickets.
3. Customers submit problems (like *“My order didn’t arrive”*).
4. Agents see tickets, reply, and mark them solved.
5. Notifications go out:

   * Customer gets an **email confirmation** when they submit a ticket.
   * Agent gets an **in-app notification** when a new ticket arrives.



### **Extra / Advanced Stuff**

* **Real-time updates** → agents don’t need to refresh the page to see new tickets.
* **AI help**:

  * Suggest replies (*AI drafts a polite answer to a customer complaint*).
  * Auto-categorize tickets (*billing issue, technical issue, etc.*).
* **Rules & Escalations**:

  * If no one answers a ticket within X hours, it gets auto-assigned or escalated.
* **Supervisor Dashboard**: shows graphs like *average response time*, *tickets solved per day*, etc.
* **Paid Plans**:

  * Free plan: maybe 2 agents, no AI.
  * Paid plan: more agents, AI features unlocked.


### **Why It’s Challenging**

* You’ll practice **multi-tenant systems** (each company has its own space).
* You’ll need **roles and permissions** (Customer vs. Agent vs. Supervisor).
* You’ll handle **notifications** (emails + real-time).
* You’ll learn **queues/schedulers** for reminders/escalations.
* You’ll integrate **AI models** into real workflows (reply suggestions, auto-tagging).
* You’ll add **Stripe billing** for SaaS subscriptions.



⚡ In short: It’s **a tool for companies to manage customer problems**, and you’ll build it in a way that looks and feels like a **real SaaS product**, not just a CRUD app.
