## Project Definition

### Purpose / Problem
- Companies get many support messages.
- It is hard to track who answered and what is pending.
- We need one place to create, view, and solve tickets.

### Main Goal / Outcome
- A simple helpdesk tool (like a small Zendesk).
- Customers can send tickets.
- Agents can reply and close tickets.
- Supervisors can see basic stats.
- Optional AI can help (suggest replies, auto-categorize).

### Success Metrics (MVP targets)
- First Response Time (FRT) median < 30 minutes (demo data acceptable).
- Time To Resolution (TTR) median < 1 day (demo data acceptable).
- Agent accepts AI suggestions â‰¥ 20% when enabled.
- < 1% error rate on main APIs (tickets list/create/update).

### Non-Goals (defer to later)
- SSO/SAML, SCIM.
- Complex billing and seat management.
- Full analytics suite and custom dashboards.
- Advanced workflow engine and macros.
